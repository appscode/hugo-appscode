### What form of payments do you accept?

You may purchase our products or upgrade your plan using an international credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) and PayPal.


### If I have multiple credit cards on file, which one do you charge?


Our billing system will attempt to charge your primary credit card.  If there is a specific card you'd like to use for payment, please make sure it is the primary credit card.

### Can I pay in advance?


No, you will be chanrged after service is provided. But we appreciate your support.


### Will I be charged when I register with a credit card?


Not exactly. When you register a credit card, our payments provider will issue a charge to verify validity of card. These charges will be automatically invalidated and should disappear from your credit card statement in 48 hours.

### When is my credit card charged for billing?


We usually charge your credit card on the 1st day of each month for the previous month's usage. For addons charged for usage by mintues will be charged at increments of 50 USD after usage.
