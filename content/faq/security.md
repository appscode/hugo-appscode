### How do I report any security issues?


If you find any vulnerabilities in AppsCode services, immediately report by email to security@appscode.com with the details of vulnerabilities arising. AppsCode appreciates working with bug reporter(s) to fix bug promptly. You can contact us securely using our PGP key found [here](/legal/security/).

### Can AppsCode provide protection against Spoofing and Sniffing?


Yes. AppsCode utilizes application isolation, operating system restrictions, and encrypted connections to further ensure risk is mitigated at all levels. Managed firewalls prevent spoofing while hypervisor helps to prevent packet sniffing.
