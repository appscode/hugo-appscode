      <description>Guard Guard by AppsCode is a Kubernetes Webhook Authentication server. Using guard, you can log into your Kubernetes cluster using a Github or Google authentication token. Guard also sets authenticated user&amp;rsquo;s groups to their Github teams or Google groups. This allows cluster administrators to setup RBAC rules based on membership in Github teams or Google groups.
From here you can learn all about Guard&amp;rsquo;s architecture and how to deploy and use Guard.</description>
