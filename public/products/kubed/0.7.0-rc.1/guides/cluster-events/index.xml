Forward Cluster Events Kubed can send notifications via Email, SMS or Chat for various cluster events. This document will show you how to use Kubed to setup an event forwarder.
Before You Begin At first, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using Minikube.</description></item><item><title>Notifiers</title><link>https://appscode-v3-hugo.web.app/products/kubed/0.7.0-rc.1/guides/cluster-events/notifiers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appscode-v3-hugo.web.app/products/kubed/0.7.0-rc.1/guides/cluster-events/notifiers/</guid><description>New to Kubed?

Supported Notifiers Kubed can send notifications via Email, SMS or Chat for various operations using appscode/go-notify library. To connect to these services, you need to create a Secret with the appropriate keys. Then pass the secret name to Kubed by setting notifierSecretName field in Kubed cluster config. Also, set clusterName to a meaningful name for you. This cluster name will be prefixed to any notification sent via Email/SMS/Chat so that you can identify the source easily.</description></item></channel></rss>
