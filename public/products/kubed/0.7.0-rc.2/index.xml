      <description>Project Status Versioning Policy Kubed does not follow semver. Currently Kubed operator implementation is considered alpha. Please report any issues you via Github. Once released, the major version of operator is going to point to the Kubernetes client-go version. You can verify this from the glide.yaml file. This means there might be breaking changes between point releases of the operator. This generally manifests as changed annotation keys or their meaning.</description>
