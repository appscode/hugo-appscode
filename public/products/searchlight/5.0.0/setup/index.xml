 Hostfacts Hostfacts is a http server used to expose various node metrics. This is a wrapper around the wonderful shirou/gopsutil library. This is used by check_node_volume and check_pod_volume commands to detect disk usage stats. To use these check commands, hostfacts must be installed directly on every node in the cluster.
