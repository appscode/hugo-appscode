      <description>Searchlight Searchlight by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for Icinga. If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you probably want to be alerted when things go wrong. Icinga periodically runs various checks on a Kubernetes cluster and sends notifications if detects an issue. It also nicely supplements whitebox monitoring tools like, Prometheus with blackbox monitoring can catch problems that are otherwise invisible, and also serves as a fallback in case internal systems completely fail.</description>
