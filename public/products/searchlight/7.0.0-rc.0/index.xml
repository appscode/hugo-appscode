      <description>Project Status Versioning Policy There are 2 parts to versioning policy:
 Operator version: Searchlight does not follow semver, rather the major version of operator points to the Kubernetes client-go version. You can verify this from the glide.yaml file. This means there might be breaking changes between point releases of the operator. This generally manifests as changed annotation keys or their meaning. Please always check the release notes for upgrade instructions.</description>

      <description>Searchlight Searchlight by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for Icinga. If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you probably want to be alerted when things go wrong. Icinga periodically runs various checks on a Kubernetes cluster and sends notifications if detects an issue. It also nicely supplements whitebox monitoring tools like, Prometheus with blackbox monitoring can catch problems that are otherwise invisible, and also serves as a fallback in case internal systems completely fail.</description>
