      <description>Stash Stash by AppsCode is a Kubernetes operator for restic. If you are running production workloads in Kubernetes, you might want to take backup of your disks. Traditional tools are too complex to setup and maintain in a dynamic compute environment like Kubernetes. restic is a backup program that is fast, efficient and secure with few moving parts. Stash is a CRD controller for Kubernetes built around restic to address these issues.</description>
